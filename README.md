# Nc

Houses the public interface for the various nc projects.

Nc does not define an acronym, it was initially meant to stand for **Not C** as in _not the C programming language_ back when the only project I was working on was a minimal C-like programming language, but that quickly faded given how gradually grandiose I wanted the programming language to be and the inception of other projects to compliment the programming language, so naturally, renaming was meant to be done, but due to laziness(most of my then code files were prefixed with _nc_) and my new found neo-nihilistic frame of thought, I opted to keep the _nc_ acronym as the umbrella term for all present and future projects but strip it of its meaning thereby making it a dead acronym, with the general idea being paraxodical that for something with no meaning represents so much meaning.

Given that _nc_ is a dead acronym, it must be written as a word(_nc_) not an acronym(_NC_) like _ecma_ formely _ECMA_.

Below are the following current projects of NC:

- **Nc programming language**
- **Nc text processing language**
- **Nc data representation language**
- **Nc markup language**
- **Nc real numbers**

There are many more nc projects to come which would mostly involve application software projects.
