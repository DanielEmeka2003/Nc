# Nc

Houses the public interface for the various nc projects.

Nc does not define an acronym, it was initially meant to stand for **Not C** as in _not the C programming language_ back when the only project I was working on was a minimal C-like programming language, but that quickly faded given how gradually grandiose I wanted the programming language to be and also with the inception of other projects to compliment the programming language, so naturally, renaming was meant to be done, but due to my laziness to think up a new name and my new found neo-nihilistic frame of thought, I opted to keep the _nc_ acronym as the umbrella term for all present and future projects but strip it of its meaning thereby making it a dead acronym, with the general idea being paradoxical that for something with no core meaning is used to refer to tools that present so much meaning.

Given that _nc_ is a dead acronym, it must be written as a word(_nc_) not an acronym(_NC_) like _ecma_ formely _ECMA_.

Below are the following current projects of nc:

- **Nc programming language**
- **Nc text processing language**
- **Nc data representation language**
- **Nc markup language**
- **Nc real numbers**

The various projects of nc are setup such as to create it's own tech stack and tech ecosystem.

There are many more nc projects to come which would mostly involve application software projects like:

- **Nc text and code editor**
- **Nc document editor**
- **Nc chat**
- **Nc operating system**
